Zikula Content
==============

Content is a page editing module for Zikula. With it you can insert and edit
various content items, such as HTML texts, videos, maps and much more.

Each page has a specific layout - single column, two or three columns, with and
without headers and footers (and you can easily add your own).

This master branch is for Zikula 1.3.x and will not work in Zikula 1.2.x

### Please note: master branch in constant development. Re-installation of module may be required in order to avoid  errors and DB corruption. If you are working with this code, keep a backup of your DB at all times!
