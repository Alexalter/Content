Zikula Content
==============

**__Requires Zikula Core 1.2.x__**

Content is a page editing module for Zikula. With it you can insert and edit various content items, such as HTML texts, videos, maps and much more.

Each page has a specific layout - single column, two or three columns, with and without headers and footers (and you can easily add your own).
