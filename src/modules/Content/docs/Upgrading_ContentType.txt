DEVELOPER CONTENTTYPE/LAYOUTTYPE UPGRADE 3.x -> 4.x
===================================================

The structure and naming schemes have changed for Content 4.x

The rules in Zikula 1.3 require classnames to begin with uppercase letters and
for underscores only used to indicate directories. Each word must be capitalized
and you cannot use other characters (numbers and letters only, but must begin
with a capital letter). For example:

Content_Form_Handler_Admin_Settings

is found in

modules/Content/lib/Content/Form/Handler/Admin/Settings.php

you can see the relationship between the classname and the directory structure.
Additional underscores, etc, are not allowed.


## Classfiles

Move your existing pncontenttypesapi files to

  ModuleName/lib/ModuleName/ContentType/Filename.php

rename the classes within to

  ModuleName_ContentType_Pluginname extends Content_ContentType_Base


Move your existing pnlayouttypesapi files to

  ModuleName/lib/ModuleName/LayoutType/Filename.php

rename the classes within to

  ModuleName_LayoutType_Pluginname extends Content_LayoutType_Base

Please note that the word 'Plugin' has been removed from classnames. Filenames
may not contain spaces or underscores and should also be corrected in the
getName method within the class.


## Templates

contentype templates may remain in the templates/contentype/ directory but must
be renamed with a .tpl suffix

The layout/ templates directory must be renamed to layouttype/ and all files
within renamed with a .tpl suffix

spaces are not allowed in any filenames.
